## Instructions

Weekly Planner.
Create a weekly planner that allows you to add or record events that will happened during the
selected week (one week at least, no need to change calendar time).
You should only have 1 event running at the same time and should validate the entries.
Add/delete/update any event in the future by selecting the date and times.
Display blocks of time of available events.
Make a difference between weekends and weekdays.
DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORK OR LIBRARY. Everything should be written in pure
Javascript and JavaScript only.
Nice to have:
- You could toggle between week and day views only (no month necessary).
- You could theme each of the entries if they belong to the same category. For example, blue
for all medical appointments.
- Request confirmation before deleting an event.
NOTES:
There is no restriction of the data model to be used, just make sure you reduce or optimize time
complexity when accessing or recording entries.

Assumptions:
HTML and CSS are allowed. Nothing said about CSS frameworks, but may as well not push it.
